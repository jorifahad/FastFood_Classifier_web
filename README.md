## **üõ†Ô∏è How It Works**
1. **Model Training**:
   - A custom AI model was trained using Google's Teachable Machine to recognize three categories: pizza, burger, and shawarma.
   - The trained model files (`model.json` and `metadata.json`) are integrated into the web app.

2. **Real-Time Classification**:
   - Upon granting camera access, the application detects and classifies food items in real-time.
   - Users can capture an image and view the classification result along with a confidence score.

3. **Data Reset**:
   - The "Reset Timer" button clears the classification result and timer, allowing for a fresh start.
